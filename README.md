# Install:

```
npm i
```

# Run:
```
npm run serve
```

**Note:** This presumes you have [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) & [lein](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed correctly.

# Editing
The files you have to care about are:
- Procfile (this does all the serving & watching)
- `src/main/acme/frontend/app.cljs`
- `public/index.html`

That's it?
